# Using Github
This project's version control repository is hosted on Github: https://github.com/cloud9-cs361/cs361-project-b

As we are all using the same machine under the same user, there is no further configuration needed.  To push to the repository, do the following:

    git add -A
    git commit -am "Enter a USEFUL comment here"
    git push
    
It should be rare that a pull request is done, but please if you develop on your own machine do so under a separate branch then merge it into master on this machine.  
Also `git add -A` is part of the sequence as it's always a good idea to make sure any new files are being tracked.
