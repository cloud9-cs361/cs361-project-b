Proposed changes:

## Application API:

* Application.getAccount() -> Application.getProviderAccount()
* Application.getAccount(query) <- search for a single account by query

## Client Constructor:

The client constructor is confusing, as we accept the entire stormpath configuration
object.  As such, to manually specify an API Key ID and Secret, you need to
do the following:

```
new stormpath.Client({
  client: {
    apiKey: {
      id: 'xxx',
      scret: 'xxx'
    }
  }
})
```

Because the client construction will never use the sibling properties of
`stormpath.web` and `stormpath.application`, we should only accept values that
can be defined by `stormpath.client`, and as such the client construction wil
look lke this:

```
new stormpath.Client({
  apiKey: {
    id: 'xxx',
    scret: 'xxx'
  }
})
```

```
new stormpath.Client({
  apiKey: {
    file: 'xxx'
  }
})
```
