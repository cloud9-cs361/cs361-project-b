# Changelog

### 0.0.20

* Similar to 0.0.14, adding a temporary patch to `ExtendConfigStrategy` to allow
  the developer to define the new `stormpath.web.produces` array.

* Add fix for `web.spa.view` validation that was crashing the Node SDK tests.

### 0.0.19

* Now validating that auto login and email verification options aren't enabled
  at the same time. (#1).

* Added debugging capabilities for debugging configuration strategies (#23).

* Fixed: Empty stormpath.apikey file clears configuration (#26).

* Fixed problem with loading API Key properties from the home path (#28).

* Add validation for the new `stormpath.web.spa.view` property.

* Updated dependencies:
  * `lodash@3.10.1` -> `lodash@4.0.0`
  * `flat@1.6.0` -> `flat@2.0.0`

### 0.0.18

* Fixed issue with expandHomeDir() not returning absolute path when home path was missing.

### 0.0.17

* Fixed issue with file loaders crashing when home environment wasn't being set.

### 0.0.16

Adding validation for account store mappings.  We now error if:

* No account stores are mapped to the given application.

* The given application does not have a default account store, and
  `stormpath.web.register.enabled` is `true`

### 0.0.15

* Patch for 0.0.14 - fixing a null reference.

### 0.0.14

* Adding a temporary patch to `ExtendConfigStrategy` to ensure that prototype
methods are not lost on `config.cacheOptions.client`.  The patch manually
replaces this property, in the future we intend to fix the extension algorithm
to support this case.

### 0.0.13

* Modified `EnrichClientFromRemoteConfigStrategy` to implement the proper
application resolution strategiey: load application by name or href, fallback
to ony application if that is the case.
